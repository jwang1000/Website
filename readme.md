# jwang1000 Website

## About

My personal website! Here is where I showcase my experience, skills, and projects. You can see the site in action at [jwang1000.com](https://jwang1000.com/).


## Running Locally

To see the website without using the internet (...despite the fact that you are on GitHub?), clone the repository. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then inside the folder, open a terminal and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. You'll be able to see the website at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
